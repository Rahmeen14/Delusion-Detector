# Delusion-Detector
## A simple Node web app that uses Random Forest Regression to detect if a to-be-employee is lying about his previous salary.


This is a simple node app that accepts a companies salary data, i.e., a .csv file that has designations, salaries for those designations and a certain preordered level assigned with each designation depending upon the salary (higher the salary, higher the level).
Besides this, the app also demands two  inputs:

- The level at which the employee was in the company (a fractional number between 1 and total number of designations) where the fractional part arises by virtue of years of experience. For instance, if I am working as a Senior Executive which is level number 6 with 3 years of experience, then if in my company promotions occur after an average of 6 years of continuing the same post, then my level becomes 6.5 

- The salary which the employee, while negotiations, claims  to have had in the previous company.

The node app.js file then sends the information to a python script that implements [Random Forest Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) , an [ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning) Machine Learning Algorithm on the data to predict the possible salary of the employee.

The app then reports whether:
- The employee is honest, i.e., told his exact salary
- The employee understated his salary
- The employee was trying to bluff the company, claiming more than he deserves. The app also gives the %Bluff of the employee

## TO DETECT DELUSION, YOU'LL NEED
```
node
python 3.6 or later
```

## INSTRUCTIONS

- clone this Delusion-Detector on your local machine
- Change the path to Python as per your machine in the options variable in app.js
- cd Delusion-Detector
- npm install
- node app.js
- Open your favorite browser and go to ```localhost:3000```
- Enter any .csv file that follows the aforementioned details(SampleData has two .csv files for reference )
- Enter any level and Claimed Salary
- The Output will be shown besides a Random Forest Regression Plot that will be saved in plotPics for trend analysis!
